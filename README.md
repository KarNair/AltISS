# AltISS
Contains file for ISS Altitude Tracking


Uses python3 and whereistheiss API to track historical and realtime tracking of ISS orbital altitude. The program generates a graph of the altitude over a user defined period of time.


__UPDATE__: The API data logging doesn't seem to work as of now. This will be fixed when I get the time to fix it. Hopefully
